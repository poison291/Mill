# Mill

**Mill** is a local-first AI chat platform designed to run large language models directly on a user’s machine. It provides a responsive, offline-first interface while maintaining the flexibility to extend and integrate new features over time.

## Overview

Mill enables interactive, multi-turn conversations with context memory. It leverages a Go backend to handle communication with locally stored LLMs and a modern React + Tailwind frontend for a clean, user-friendly interface.

The system is designed to prioritize privacy and independence, allowing users to interact with AI models without relying on cloud services or external accounts.
